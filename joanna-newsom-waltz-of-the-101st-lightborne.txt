Waltz of the 101st Lightborne
Joanna Newsom

    Am              Gm            Dm   Bb 
I believed they had got what they came for;
    F          Bb        Dm
I believed our peril was done,
       Am         Gm          Dm    Bb
on the eve of the last of the Great Wars,
      F            Bb       Dm
after three we had narrowly won.
         F              Bb         F
(But the fourth, it was carelessly done.)

        Am          Gm         A7  Bb
Saw his ship in its whistling ascension,
        F                 Bb      G7sus
as they launched from the Capitol seat—
        Am      Gm               A7     Dm
swear I saw our mistake when the clouds draped 
       F                Bb           F
like a flag, across the backs of the fleet
       F             Bb          F
of the Hundred-First Lightborne Elite.

       Am     Gm7          F         Am
As the day is long, so the well runs dry,
       Eb                  Bb          F        C
and we came to see Time is taller than Space is wide.
       Am        Gm7       F       Am
And we bade goodbye to the Great Divide:
      Eb             Bb         F    C
found unlimited simulacreage to colonize!

                Am           Gm            Dm Bb
But there was a time we were lashed to the prow
     F            Bb             Dm
of a ship you may board, but not steer,
       Am        Gm             Dm Bb
before You and I ceased to mean Now, 
    F             Bb         Dm
and began to mean only Right Here
         F          Bb             F
(to mean Inches and Miles, but not Years);

        Am         Gm           A7 Bb
before Space had a taste of its limits,
      F             Bb        G7sus
and a new sort of coordinate awoke,
       Am         Gm          A7 Bb
making Time just another poor tenant:
        F              Bb            Dm
bearing weight, taking fire, trading smokes,
       F           Bb         F
in the war between us and our ghosts.

               Am         Gm7        F      Am
(But I saw the Bering Strait and the Golden Gate,
   Eb         Bb              F      C
in silent suspension of their golden age! 
            Am        Gm7     F        Am
And you can barely tell, if I guard it well,
      Eb               Bb        F       C
where I have been, and seen, pristine, unfelled.)

            Am           Gm            Dm Bb 
And I had a dream that I walked in the garden
      F              Bb        Dm
of Chabot, and those telescope ruins.
       Am           Gm           Dm   Bb
It was there that I called to my true love,
        F          Bb      Dm
who was pale as millennial moons, 
       F             Bb           F
Honey, where did you come by that wound?

       Am           Gm           A7        Bb
When I woke, he was gone and the War had begun,
    F        Bb         G7sus
in eternal return and repeat.
         Am           Gm           A7           Bb
Calling, Where in the hell are the rest of your fellow
    F           Bb          F
One-Hundred-One Lightborne Elite?
               F            Bb         F
stormed in the New Highland Light Infantry.

        Am          Gm7        F        Am
Make it stop, my love! We were wrong to try.
      Eb                Bb          F         C
Never saw what we could unravel, in traveling light,
           Am          Gm7      F        Am
or how the trip debrides—like a stack of slides!
       Eb                   Bb          F        C
All we saw was that Time is taller than Space is wide.

                  Am         Gm           Dm Bb 
That's why we got bound to a round desert island,
           F             Bb           Dm
'neath the sky where our sailors have gone.
          Am          Gm          Dm  Bb 
Have they drowned, in those windy highlands?
F          Bb      F
Highlands away, my John.
