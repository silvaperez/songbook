B                     F#                 A
What we built, at the kiln that won’t be stilled
        G
Did not set well:
    B                 F#                        A
The old veil of desire, like the vessels that we fired
             G
Fell thin as eggshells

    Bm                     D                       
And every season, somebody burns Downtown, taking turns–
C                            G
Taking a bus, to take a train and just plain vamoose
Bm                                      D
Now the wind blows coals over the hills. Honey I’ve been paying my bills
    C                                     G
But honey it’s been a long time since I’ve come to any use

Bm                                      
And it hurt me bad, when I heard the news
           D
That you’d got that call, and could not refuse
   A                                      E
(A goose, alone, I suppose, can know the loneliness of geese
                               D                              A               F#m
Who never find their peace, whether North, or South, or West, or East, West or East;
            E                               D                                    A
And I could never find my way to being the kind of friend you seemed to need in me
G               F
Till the needing had ceased.)

B            F#                         A
Recently, a bottle of rye, and a friend, and me
       G                     B                   F#
On our five loose legs had a ramble, and spoke
       A                    G                            
Of the scrambling of broken hopes, and goose eggs

    Bm                      D
And of a stranger, long ago (Not you, honey! You, I know.)
        C                         G
We just spoke of broken hopes and old strangers
        Bm                            D
Now the wind blows coals over the sea. Tell you what, honey: You and me 
C                             G
better run and see if we can’t contain them, first

        Bm
But you had somewhere that you had to go
        D
And you caught that flight out of Covelo
     A                         E
Now, overhead, you’re gunning in those Vs
                                         D                                A              F#m
Where you had better find your peace, whether North, or South, or West, or East, West or East
          E                               D                                    A
And I had better find my way to being the kind of friend you seemed to need in me
   G        F              E
At last, at least, what’s redacted will repeat
        D                                   A                      F#m
And you cannot learn that you burn when you touch the heat...so we touch the heat
       E                 D                             A
And we cut facsimiles of love and death (just separate holes in sheets
                 G                       F
Where you cannot breathe, and you cannot see)
             E                        D
And I cannot now, for the life of me, believe our talk –
    A
Our flock had cause to leave
F#m
But do we? Do we?
